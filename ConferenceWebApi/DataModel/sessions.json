    "description": "It takes time to become really good at something. Time, commitment and a genuine passion. If you're not having fun the learning is a chore, if you are then it hardly feels like learning at all, at least not like the thing they made you do in school. Craftsmanship is about making that commitment and then figuring out how to see it through.  Using examples of mastery from various fields and a thirty year paper-folding habit, Dan describes some of the many facets of craftsmanship and tries to figure out exactly what the craft is that we programmers do.",

In this talk I'll demonstrate what async functions look like, then dive into how they work under the hood. Be warned: once you've used C# 5, all other asynchronous code will look atrocious.",

    "description": "Erlang is an industry-proven functional programming language with unmatched sweet-spots in fault-tolerance, concurrency, and distribution. RabbitMQ, CouchDB. Facebook Chat, Opcode Chef, and WhatsApp are written in Erlang, and more than half of the world's mobile phone traffic is driven by Erlang. Erlang is also opensource, and cross-platform.\nCQRS is an architectural pattern that separates commands (which mutate state) from queries (which return values). With CQRS the &ldquo;read&rdquo; data store and the &ldquo;write&rdquo; data store can be on different severs, can use different storage engines, and can be scaled independently. CQRS is often linked with the Event Sourcing pattern which models state as a series of events (past tense verbs) rather than a single &ldquo;latest&rdquo; value. What works for an accountant&rsquo;s ledger (and for Git) can work for our &ldquo;write&rdquo; store too. Given a series of events, we can deal with concurrency and collisions more intelligently than &ldquo;last guy wins&rdquo;. We can also define varied service level agreements for our commands and our queries.\nCQRS promotes distribution, concurrency and eventual consistency which is dandy until we attempt to code an implementation with conventional tools like C# or Java. Lucky for us, Erlang is unconventional in all the right ways. Many of the ideas of CQRS dovetail perfectly with the sweet-spots of Erlang.In this session we will dive into CQRS, and explore a sample implementation written in Erlang. We will spotlight a few areas where CQRS with Erlang shines.",

Changes to the client library can become amaintenance headache.\nThis talk will demonstrate how to build client libraries that make your API just as easy to access without hiding it behind a procedural faÃ§ade. This approach will allow client devs thechance to upgrade to new versions of client libraries on their own schedule or take advantage of new features without waiting for you to release a new version of the client library. It also enables you to provide client developers with default response handling behaviors they can choose to use orreplace with their own. As an added benefit, this approach is highly compatible with the use of hypermedia so can ease the path when introducing hypermedia into your API.",

OWIN defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications enabling OWIN based applications to run on any OWIN capable host. In this presentation you will learn the what and why of OWIN and how OWIN is now deeply integrated with the ASP.NET pipeline. You'll learn how you can easily host OWIN based components inside of ASP.NET or in your own process. I'll show you how you can take advantage of existing Microsoft OWIN components to handle security, diagnostics, servicing static content and running a variety of OWIN based frameworks. Lastly I will show you how you can create your own OWIN middleware and participate in the OWIN ecosystem",

Does that mean you can't deliver large-scale programmes using agile methods? Not at all. But to scale you need something else, something substantively different, something the Agile Manifesto and the existing team-scale agile methods don't even have an opinion about.\nI have seen a handful of successful large-scale deliveries across multiple agile teams, multiple locations and multiple timezones. At this scale the challenges start to look uncomfortably like those of traditional programmes, and involve phrases like delivery assurance, governance and portfolio management. They just approach them differently.\nWhat made them work? The challenge is getting large numbers of people to think in the same direction. Shared guiding principles, a clear vision and a common understanding enable what I call contextual consistency. I believe this one lever is the single greatest enabler of technology delivery at scale, and is at the heart of the thing we call empowerment. In this talk I will explain why.",

We need libraries which can support this need for all of our runtimes, whether it is .NET, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, Python PHP or any JVM language.\nWith the C# and Visual Basic language features added to .NET 4.5, an imperative approach to sequential composition and orchestration of asynchronous operations has been introduced. Come and learn how the Reactive Extensions (Rx) complement this feature set, adding the notion of multi-value asynchronous observable sequences with full-fledged LINQ support. In addition, with JavaScript and the notion of promises, we will sketch out how RxJS plays in the world of asynchronous computations.\nIn this demo-intensive session, we will sketch out the asynchronous and event programming landscape, and dive into the unique role played by Rx. After explaining the design philosophy of Rx, rooted in the deep duality between enumerable and observable sequences, we will cover the rich set of query operators that enable complex event processing. Next, the synergy between Rx and the existing asynchronous solutions such as Tasks in .NET and Promises in JavaScript.\nDemocratizing asynchronous and event-based processing starts today in your language of choice!",

In the real world automated testing efforts frequently fail because the tests are too time-consuming to author, too brittle when the underlying application changes, too flaky with asynchronous timing, or just flat out too slow. In this talk I&rsquo;ll share some of my lessons learned over the years on the mechanics of automated testing and how the desire for automated testing changes your architectural decision making. For specifics, I&rsquo;d like to show how my teams have been able to quickly set up a known application state with RavenDb, how we keep our test harness code synchronized with the application, and dealing with asynchronous functionality in both web interfaces and distributed service bus architectures. In the realm of semi-manual testing, I&rsquo;d also like to show how we&rsquo;re embedding reusable &ldquo;scenario&rsquo;s&rdquo; into our test environments and supporting the &ldquo;press F5 and run the entire distributed application in one process&rdquo; strategy for faster and more productive manual testing and troubleshooting.",

All of these challenges stem from your design and addressing them properly is a hard core engineering task &ndash; designing the project. But no plan survives unscathed the first day of the project &ndash; priorities, resources, deadlines, estimations and features change, and you must constantly adapt the plan for the new reality.

A consistent, shared vision is essential in order for teams to push in the same direction, but it's surprising that many agile teams struggle to effectively communicate the architecture of the software they are building. As an industry we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), yet many people favour informal boxes and lines sketches instead. The problem is that such diagrams rarely make any sense, usually need a narrative to accompany them and ultimately slow the team down. Although we can argue whether UML offers an effective way to communicate software architecture, that's often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown out UML or simply don't know it. Abandoning UML is one thing but, in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually.\nThis session is aimed at everybody involved in the software development process and is about improving architectural communication in an agile environment.

As for these applications even small mistakes can quickly cause big losses, you better describe them in a way that both the business and the development team can understand them.\nIn Given-When-Then based BDD frameworks, like Cucumber or SpecFlow, you normally use Scenario Outlines for describing these. But are we sure that this is the best? Is this really the best way? Have you ever struggled with formatting big gherkin tables, hunting number precision issues or spending hours of recalculating the input-output tables?\nIn our projects most of the stakeholders use and like Excel for describing these and they are masters in doing this. Excel seems to be their DSL, so let's try to use it for generating automated tests!",

I will in this talk show you how to configure TeamCity and Octopus Deploy to be able to set up new deployments in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days.\nTo be able to set up deployment in minutes and deploy at the same speed enables you to try new things and respond to errors faster. If you have confident in how you do deployment a lot of the fear of deploying will disappear and you can focus on developing great applications instead of being afraid of breaking something.\nThe configuration I&rsquo;ll present is a setup I&rsquo;ve put together after introducing TeamCity and Octopus Deploy for multiple customers with great success. I&rsquo;ve successfully managed to simplify the deployment process of regular web applications, EPiServer applications, Windows Services and even SharePoint. I will also cover the most of the features in Octopus Deploy, which include deployment to Azure and database migrations.\nI have two goals with this talk:\n\nWhen you leave this you&rsquo;ll have the tools necessary to setup a smooth continuous integration environment with deployment.\nThe next time you do a deployment you&rsquo;ll do it with a smile instead of fear of breaking anything.\n",

In this session I&rsquo;ll show you how to mix ASP.NET MVC with KnockoutJS to develop web applications that stand strong in today&rsquo;s world of rich, interactive sites. But it won&rsquo;t be limited to just these two technologies. You see in order to keep things on a single page that flips around different modes, you need to go quietly to the server without anybody knowing (shhh), and for that I&rsquo;ll throw in the Web API. In the end you&rsquo;ll be able to write apps that get a server view when they need to using MVC then stay on the client and flip around multiple modes using Knockout, and remember, keep it quiet that I&rsquo;ll be using Web API to do a little bit server access.",

However, in the years since the Agile Manifesto, the increasing popularity of agile and the dramatic improvements it brings has pushed it onto larger and larger projects. Additionally, having an entire team--especially on a large project--in one room, or even one building is a luxury no longer enjoyed by many projects.\nIn this presentation, we will look at how agile can be scaled to work on any multi-team project. Even a project with two teams will benefit from learning how to proactively manage interteam dependencies, conduct iteration planning for multiple teams, cultivate communities of practice, and coordinating work. Because so many projects are spread across multiple sites we will also look at overcoming the unique challenges facing distributed teams. We will look at deciding how to distribute a team, how to create coherence among team members, the importance of getting together and when are the most important times to use the travel budget, changes to what the team documents, and how to handle meetings when spread across timezones. Whether your project is spread across two locations in the same city or spread around the globe, you will leave with practical advice to try tomorrow.",

Using only a simple text editor and a command prompt, I will show you how you can harness the power of C# in a scripting environment. See how NuGet integration makes it easy to use your favorite frameworks and packages directly from your command line. Learn how you can bootstrap your environment with script packs to further reduce the amount of code you need to write to setup your favorite frameworks. Come to this talk to experience C# on a diet - a new, leaner way to develop.",

    "description": "Reactive programming marks a major shift in the way we build asynchronous and event driven applications, replacing imperative control flow constructs with declarative data flow. Knowing what's going on under-the-covers can remove some of the mystique, and leave you better able to reason about the data flow in your own Reactive applications. Learn how Microsoft's Reactive Extensions work by joining us as we reimplement the core functionality from scratch.",
